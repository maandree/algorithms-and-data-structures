/**
 * Multibinary search class. Multibinary search runs with time complexity
 * ùìû(log n + m) and memory complexity ùìû(log m), where n is the number of
 * elements in the array to be searched, and m is the number of items for
 * which to search. Multibinary search locates multiple items in an array
 * effectively, the items to locate must however be unique and stored in
 * a sorted list. The algorithm only works with sorted arrays. Identity
 * search is not possible, only equality search. Null elements are not
 * allowed, unless the specified compator allows it.
 * 
 * This algorithm was devised by Mattias Andr√©e in February of 2013.
